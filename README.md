Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback or suggestions.

To-Do List - Created a personalized to-do list application from scratch, leveraging my foundational understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I followed a comprehensive tutorial provided by GreatStack, which guided me through the entire development process.


While I'm primarily using this repository for personal learning, I'm open to contributions from others.
